## About me


I am a third-year *Computer Engineering* student in the **ECE** department.
I am interested in learning more about software development and improving my own communication skills and technical ability.
I have a moderate amount of experience with programming, and I would like to continue building on what I already know.

## Sample Code

```
print("Hello world!")
```
